## Taxonomy of Reading

Reading is classified into 4 levels
1. Elementary Reading
2. Inspectional Reading
3. Analytical Reading
4. Syntopical Reading

If you're graduating high school, you should've mastered analytical reading, if you are a college graduate, you should have mastered syntopical reading (even if you haven't accomplished anything else).
