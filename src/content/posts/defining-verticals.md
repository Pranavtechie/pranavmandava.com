## What is a Vertical

- Any human work can only be possible in these sectors
- Each of the fields are discernable and are required for flourishing of a civilization
- Each fields progress can be quantifiable and a progress in the vertical would translate improvement in the civilization’s capability
- Notes

## The “Verticals”

- Agriculture
- Commerce
- Communication
- Defense
- Education
- Energy
- Entertainment
- Faith & Philosophy
- Finance
- Healthcare
- Infrastructure (Housing)
- Manufacturing
- Science
- Social Structure
- Space
- Sports
- Technology

## What is a vertical?

### V1

- A system has multiple components, each of which can be understood to have a separate function.
- Now, multiple systems have similar functions across them. These can be sliced and compared to each other.
- These slices would be verticals.

### V2

- Verticals are the pillars of human civilization.
- They are the pillars upon which humanity survives and progresses.
- Could they be divided into two parts? Pillars that came out of survival, and pillars that came out of progress.
- Each pillar acts as a

### Properties of a "Vertical" (Built from First Principles)

From first principles: Human societies organize activities into fundamental domains (sectors) to sustain, advance, and enrich collective existence. These domains emerge from basic needs (survival, growth, interaction) and evolve into specialized systems. Building on your notes:

1. Exclusivity: All human endeavors fit within one or more verticals; no activity exists outside them.

2. Discernibility: Each vertical is distinct, with unique functions, goals, and boundaries, avoiding overlap in core purpose.

3. Necessity for Civilization: Essential for societal flourishing; absence or weakness in any hinders overall progress.

4.Quantifiable Progress: Advancement measurable via metrics (e.g., output, efficiency, innovation); improvements enhance civilization's capabilities.

5.Systemic Structure: Comprises multiple interconnected components/subsystems, each with specialized functions.

6. Interdependence: Verticals interact; progress in one supports others (e.g., Technology aids Agriculture).

7. Scalability: Applicable across civilizations, from primitive to advanced, with evolving complexity.

8. Universality: Timeless and cross-cultural, rooted in human nature and societal needs.

### Formal Definition

A "vertical" is a fundamental, discernible sector of human activity that encompasses all possible work within its domain, is essential for the sustenance and advancement of civilization, features quantifiable progress directly tied to societal capability enhancement, and consists of interdependent systems with specialized functional components.

—--

Autonomy: Each vertical functions semi-independently while integrating with others.

Adaptability: Evolves with societal changes and challenges.

Foundational Hierarchy: Some are basic (survival-oriented) vs. advanced (expansion-oriented).

Sustainability: Ensures long-term viability without depleting resources.

Innovation Catalyst: Drives targeted breakthroughs that ripple across civilization.

Cultural Embedment: Influences and reflects societal values and norms.

Resource Dependency: Requires specific inputs (human, material, knowledge) for operation.

Risk Profile: Poses unique threats and mitigation needs to societal stability.

These expand the list; no exhaustive set exists, as verticals are conceptual frameworks.
